Nathan Conn, Elon Gates

This is a webpage dedicated to showcasing the growing resume and programming portfolio of Nathan Conn.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown

## Description

A webpage with links to other webpages which includes an About Me section and photos with frames and captions, a resume, a page linked to my other projects, including a GIS project I worked on several years ago, and my contact information.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Any browser, with a preference for Chrome


You will want to clone this from the repository as is!

## Known Bugs

* No bugs known thus far, however the display does change spacing depending on which monitor I am viewing it on. On my old 720p LG screen the width of the columns and boxes on the landing page require different sizing specs than the 4k monitor sitting next to it, which stands to reason, however am looking for a fix to stabilize that screen ratio between devices.
