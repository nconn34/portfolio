  <p>Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio project! I am currently embarking on a career change and am excited and nervous and hopeful to see what the future will hold! I guess, in general, I am somebody who likes a challenge and a sense of adventure. I am the first person in my family to attend a four year university and earned my Bachelor of Arts in History through the University of Wisconsin. I then went on to earn my teaching credentials at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and would teach in Milwaukee for the next four years.</p>

  <p>I knew I wanted to be a teacher, and at the time in the state the politics were quite contentious and heated, so it was a tense atmosphere to enter the workforce under, but it was during this time that I absolutely fell in love with project based learning. While working at a STEM school I was able to help plan and build many cross-collaborative projects, especially with the CTE teachers. I think it was my exposure to hands-on learning practices that made me want to push the bounds of my own learning, and so I decided to pursue a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Sciences. I had taken a couple of cartography courses where I was first introduced to GIS, but I decided I would try my hand at learning the skill more in-depth.It was during this program that I first learned how to use Python and SQL through a GUI (although before this program at Epicodus I didnâ€™t even entirely understand what that meant!) and found myself really enjoying the data retrieval and projection element of map making.
